### Step 7:-

After generating the gcode format then follow the these instruction as shown in below figure.
1. Switch on the 3d printer.
2. Place your Pen drive in USB.
3. Clean the surface bed plate.
4. Load filament into the required extruder as per the requirement.
5. Wait until the nozzle & bed plate comes into the required temperature.
6. Close the doors of the 3d printer.
7. Open the file from the USB storage and select the Print option.
